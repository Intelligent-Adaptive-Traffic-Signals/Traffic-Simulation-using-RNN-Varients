# 🚦 Traffic Simulation using RNN Variants

An intelligent, adaptive traffic signal control system powered by deep learning and time-series forecasting to reduce congestion, waiting times, and environmental impact — all simulated using SUMO and Python.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements an **adaptive traffic signal control system** that predicts traffic volume using classical and deep learning models. The predictions are then used to dynamically adjust traffic light timings in a simulated intersection using **SUMO** (Simulation of Urban Mobility) and **TraCI (Traffic Control Interface)**.

### ✨ Key Features
- Real-time simulation of traffic using SUMO.
- Prediction of upcoming traffic volume using:
  - ARIMA
  - LSTM
  - BiLSTM
  - GRU
  - BiGRU
- Dynamic traffic light control based on prediction.
- Performance analysis via average waiting time, queue length, travel time, and CO₂ emission estimation.
- Visualizations of traffic trends and model accuracy.

## 🚦 How the System Works

1. **SUMO** simulates real traffic conditions at an actual intersection (Barakhamba-Tolstoy Road, Delhi).
2. **TraCI** retrieves traffic metrics like vehicle count, queue length, and waiting time in real time.
3. The selected forecasting model predicts the traffic volume for upcoming steps.
4. Based on these predictions, the system adjusts green signal durations dynamically.
5. Simulation metrics and model performance are logged and visualized.

## ▶️ How to Run

1. **Install requirements** (create a `requirements.txt` if needed):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. **Install SUMO**:
   - Download from: https://www.eclipse.org/sumo/
   - Add SUMO to your system `PATH`.

3. **Run the Simulation**:
   ```bash
   python simulation_run.py
   ```

4. **Modify the model used**:
   In `simulation_run.py`, update:
   ```python
   model_type = 'lstm'  # options: 'arima', 'lstm', 'bilstm', 'gru', 'bigru'
   ```
